# Weather Widget Project 
A simple weather widget built with vanilla JavaScript to practice working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript features like fetch() and async/await.

## Features 
- Display current weather data for a specific location (in this project — Odesa, Ukraine)
- Refresh weather information using a refresh button
- Display additional weather details such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and a matching weather icon

## Technologies Used 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Skills Practiced 
- Fetching and processing data from an external API
- Using async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handling errors with try/catch
- DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering
  
## What I Learned
- How to fetch and display real-time data from an API
- How to structure asynchronous code using async/await
- How to update the UI dynamically based on fetched data
- How to create small, reusable rendering functions
- How to make interactive UI elements like a refresh button with animations
